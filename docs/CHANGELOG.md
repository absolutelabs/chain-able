# 3.0.0
- MAJOR
  - 🏷 version bump 📜 minor scripts
  - 🆙.remapKey -> .remap (accepts an object, or .remapKey)
  - 🗑🤖 .from in compose/Transform removed, transformers work in .merge, .set, .from, etc.
  - 🗑 removed .whitelist from compose/Traverse
  - transformers[key] is now an array, to .reduce values with, vs replacing and having only 1 transformer per key
- PATCH:
  - allow .transform to take in any traversable, nested conditional: compatible boolean to still use .entries(true) | this, but when an iteratable is passed in, returns traverser chain on that iteratable
- MINOR:
  - 📦⬇ remove izz
  - 🆙🔬    update traverse tests with inlined equals
  - 🆙🔬🗺 update remap test
  - 📘🔬 example mobx test
  - 🆙🔬👂 update & add more observe tests
  - 🖇🔬 utils/is tests
  - 🆙🎼🔬 update & add more dot-prop tests
  - 🚨🔬⚒ failing merge tests that wanted .clone fixed
  - 💣🛅🏗 fuse-box file added for building with quantum
  - 📦🐈 yarn.lock
  - 🏗 Makefile
  - 👕⚒ lint autofixes & 📝 todo in 🎼 compose/Define
  - 👾♻️⚡ simplify the symbol & typechecks in core lib
  	- abstract out `reduce` for maps & `isObjWithKeys` into `is`
  - 🎁⚒ dot-prop implemented with .get .set .has .delete in 🎼 compose/DotProp
  - ⚒👂 observables fixed, only calls on changed
    - ⚖️ ===? deps/transformers/eq added for traversable minimal deepEquals implementation
  - 🏛️  refactor traverse with deps/is
  - 🖇   traverser util for cloning, unused
  - ❌🌊 remove some minor flowtypes for easier usage from raw source
  - 👾 dopemerge simplified
  - 📒🚚🖇 symbols & is[X] moved into individual files
  	- 🖇🎯 to-test util (str->regex/fn)
  	- 🖇🎯 str-to-regex util
  	- 🖇🗺 map reduce util
  	- 🖇🤸 split dot-prop-path-segments util
  	- 🖇🆙 minor dot-prop change to use deps/is
  	- 🍬 .getDecoration 🖇 use is & other deps
    - index files for the folders are compat for experimentation when needed
    - reduces file size
      - instead of assigning data to an object & spreading the data into named variables
      - additionally smaller variable names when uniquing those scoped variables in each file when bundling into a single file
      - smaller functions are optimized faster (usually) by v8
      - moves them out of every instantiated object as a property and only uses reference by scope
      - ♻️⚡ abstract out `encase` fn
  - 🔊 changelog added
  - 🚨🔬 failing tests for traversing a map & set without transforming with .entries & .values first
  - ⛑🛅🔬 safety in built for .entries, yay tests
